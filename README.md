This is a Java-Based Sudoku Solver that solves any 3x3 board. If an impossible board is inputted, the program will not compute it, and will prompt the user that it is an unsolvable board. Version 1.0.0 is text-based. This program uses recursive methods to solve the board correctly. I have included comments within the java project files to explain how it works.

# Installation
There are 2 ways currently to use this program.
## Downloading the SudokuSolver.jar File(Located in the SudokuSolverVX.X.X folder)
## and running through CMD



## Importing the project into an IDE(Project located in the SudokuSolverVX.X.X folder)
I have put the project files on github for users to import into their IDEs and experiment with/see how the solver works.

Importing the project may depend on the IDE you use so I have left some tutorials below if you need help figuring that out:

* [Eclipse](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~kaharris/10200/tutorials/eclipse/import.html)
* [Visual Studio](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/guide/step-by-step/importing/vscode)
